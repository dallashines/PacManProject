# PacManProject

New repository designated for a quick project created during my current MITxPro course.  ⚙️  🔧

This project was designed to structure a .javascript code (to possibly be included within an .html file) ,

enabling a classic PacMan 🎮 character to run across the webpage screen , turn @ the page boundary ,

and continue it's way to where it began it's journey; thus , starting once again from the beginning .

As you can see within the included .javascript file , 2 different functions are deployed , 👾

accessing a 2 dimensional array that includes 4 different images of the PacMan character .

This array enables the code to 'bring life' to the image on the screen , switching between

different frames of reference according to the .png files that are called upon via function .

Harnessing either a setInterval or setTimeout function @ whatever desired timing ( 70ms ) ,

the code brings movement into the equation , and PacMan traversing across whatever screen .
